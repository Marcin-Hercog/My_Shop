An application with which you can manage the database by typing a right command. 
So far I implemented such options as adding, removing, showing and returning.
I used Entity Framework Core and Code First method.
I also used Fluent API instead of Data Annotiation to configurate properties of classes and references between them.
I remember having a problem with setting the connection to local database correctly. It was an opportunity to get to know Stack Overflow.
At the moment I am learning how to implement feature updating of the currently existing data.
